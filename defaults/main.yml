# TLS levels derived from https://medium.com/@davetempleton/tls-configuration-cipher-suites-and-protocols-a01ee7005778
# low is super-compatible but enables weaker ciphers to support IE8/XP. Should be avoided, particularly with SNI
# med is conservative, widely compatible, and secure. meets BOD18-01
# high is very secure and compatible with anything modern. should be used whenever possible
# veryhigh is insane and likely unnecessary
#
# the levels just set default cipher / ssl lists
# specific cipher / ssl lists can be provided using the following undefined vars:
